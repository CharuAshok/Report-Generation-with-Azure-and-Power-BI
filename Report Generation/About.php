					<p class="text-justify">Whilst we love serving our local community, we are not limited by geography and serve the wider communities of leisure and tourism and renewable energy, as well as providing general insurance.

We are an independent company with access to a wide range of insurers. This allows us to offer a wide range of insurance products that reflect your personal, business, leisure and lifestyle interests.

We offer a professional but personal service and treat our clients as we would wish to be treated ourselves. Yet the words 'personal service' need not mean additional expense as we seek high quality products that offer value for money for our clients.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">At Everest Insurance Agency, we strive for quality service with your convenience in mind. By offering 24/7/365 support, we’re here to serve you – when you need us most. Since accidents and non-collision oriented situations can fall outside of normal business hours, we’ve partnered with Allied Insurance’s On Your Side® service center to provide you with extended hours in case you need assistance. 

For claims, accidents, billing information, and more, you can contact an Allied representative 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 800-282-1446.</p>
